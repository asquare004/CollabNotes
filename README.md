## Description
We were given code of a note editor by our mentors. We were supposed to build a chatbox and integrate it to the note editor.
## Tech Stack Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
## Development Methodology
First we will add a chat icon at the bottom left corner of the note editor. When the chat icon is clicked, a small chatbox should pop up. This chatbox will contain all features essential for chatting. Anyone using the server will be able to chat with each other through this chatbox.
