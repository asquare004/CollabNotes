## Tech Stack Used
* HTML

## Development
We will first create a chat icon at the left bottom corner of the editor using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When the chat icon is clicked, it will open a small chatbox. Anyone using the server will be able to chat with each other. We can build this with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js.
